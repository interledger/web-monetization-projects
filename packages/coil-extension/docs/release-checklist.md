# Release Checklist

Follow these steps, for both desktop Chrome and Firefox and at least one android build before
releasing, and commit a refinement!

As we currently have little to no automated tests (or even a specification) when you fix
an issue, add a step to the testing checklist for each feature/bug added, with a link to
the issue/PR.

When releasing, we can copy this markdown into the PR for a release.

## Chores

- [ ] Make sure the manifest version was bumped but doesn't skip versions

- [ ] Update the [apktool.yml](../six-apktool-decoded/apktool.yml) versionCode/versionName
      and commit it to the repository.

- [ ] Update the [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md)

  - You can compare with latest commit before tagging via something like:
    `https://github.com/coilhq/web-monetization-projects/compare/coil-extension@0.0.48...8f359e45f843a4f9a01c090a02e73519413d900b`

### Zipping Extension Source Files

- [ ] Zip the source code for the extension

  - Some web stores will require the submission of source files.
  - So far, zipping the `coil-extension` folder (instead of zipping at the project root)
    has given us the least trouble with passing review.
    - For example, `zip -r coil-extension.zip coil-extension/`
  - `node_modules` should be deleted prior to zipping the source files.

## $Platform $Browser \$Version

Copy below for each platform/browser/version tested, filtering steps where it
make sense.

- [ ] Build for prod with release settings

  - e.g. `yarn build-prod chrome -p --run-prod --devtool=none`
    - as per [package.sh](../package.sh)

- [ ] Import unpacked/temporary extension/add-on

  - For Firefox, go to `about:debugging`
    - Enable add-on debugging
    - Load Temporary Add-on...
  - For Chrome or MS Edge, go to `chrome://extensions` (or `edge://extensions`) and `Load Unpacked`
  - Use `adb` to install Samsung Internet Extensions
    - be sure to kill the browser and delete shared settings to be sure correct addon is tested
    - see code in `scripts/reinstall-six.sh`

- [ ] Ensure that you are [logged in with a user with valid subscription](https://coil.com/settings/membership)

  - Only required on desktop browsers
  - Should animate when monetized and packets received
  - Should stop animation when network disconnected
    - Note that on Firefox/MacOS the popup automatically closes when the

    immediately after page load or meta tag added

      the dist folder, then open [static/popup.html](static/popup.html) in a
      normal tab and check the popup rendering in various states.

- [ ] If the browser is running on android, check that the "popup" browser action
      simply opens settings.

### Iframe testing

1. - [ ] Open a terminal and `cd packages/coil-extension/test/fixtures/iframes/`
2. - [ ] Start a server (via `python -m http.server 4000` or equivalent)
3. - [ ] Open http://localhost:4000/top-nested-allowed-iframe.html in browser
4. Open developer tools and look at the structure of the dom

- Use expand recursively feature
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/525211/76400168-71098800-63b2-11ea-8069-5ee7b8b0707a.png)

5. - [ ] With the console set `localStorage.WM_DEBUG = true`

#### Test 1: basic monetization

1. Load the page
2. - [ ] Look for 4 monetizationpending events and 4 corresponding (same requestId) monetizationstart events logged in the console.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/525211/76397844-6a791180-63ae-11ea-8f1c-72ef3a6183fb.png)

#### Test 2: refresh page / turn off / turn on

1. - [ ] [re]load the page
2. - [ ] Open developer tools and turn "off" monetization via editing allow attribute of top level iframes
   - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/525211/76398261-28040480-63af-11ea-85cb-396960ced1bb.png)
   - Popup icon (and background page logging) should show no monetization:
     - [ ] ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/525211/76398281-305c3f80-63af-11ea-857c-6ab6b409daa5.png)
   - Corresponding monetization events should be logged:
     - [ ] ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/525211/76398873-3999dc00-63b0-11ea-8ee6-7ca45d8b44f0.png)

3. turn "on" monetization via editing allow attribute of top level iframes
   - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/525211/76398370-57b30c80-63af-11ea-86a8-133271e46b91.png)
   - [ ] Popup icon (and background page logging) should show monetization
     - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/525211/76398417-6d283680-63af-11ea-88e6-c4b0ed5c35f7.png)
   - [ ] Corresponding monetization events should be logged:
     - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/525211/76399026-841b5880-63b0-11ea-8b0b-c0ecbff13bee.png)

#### Test 3: refresh page / turn off / background tab / turn on / foreground tab

- As above but while the tab is backgrounded, after turning on each top level iframe a sequence of pending -> stopped events should be fired:
  - [ ] ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/525211/76399956-1a03b300-63b2-11ea-9b77-671e94a1bf16.png)

#### Test 4: nested

- As per test 2
- Turn off one top level and then turn off the nested frames in top level that is allowed
- [ ] allow _one_ nested iframe and check for indications of monetization
