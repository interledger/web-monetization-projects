  /**
   * Problem
   *
   * In manifest version 3, ServiceWorkers require all event listeners to be bound
   * in the same "tick" when the background page module is instantiated. Top level
   * here is in the same sense as `async await` top level functions.
   *
   * Why do they do this? It's because they (I assume synchronously??) start a worker
   * if none is already active and then dispatch it an event. If you construct the
   * object graph of your background page service asynchronously and some listeners
   * are bound too late they will not catch the event that was dispatched (the
   * reason for which the worker was [re]started)
   *
   * Above, I parenthetically pointed out my assumption that the workers are
   * synchronously started and then an event is dispatched. Is this really the case?
   * Wouldn't loading the background script from a crx or cache be an operation that
   * is done asynchronously? If so, why not add an api to mark the background as
   * ready to service events?
   *
   * What about runtime.oninstall ?
   *
   * When is the oninstall event dispatched ?
   * It seems to happen quite some time after install and background service
   * instantiation.
   *
   * Solution[s]
   *
   * 1. Buffer the events
   *
   *    It wouldn't do to just execute a listener right upon binding, one
   *    buffered event after another.  You would need to keep track of the
   *    listeners in case you had, say, 3,buffered events (unlikely but perhaps
   *    possible). The events must be emitted in order, looping through the
   *    listeners for each.
