# puppeteer

There are currently some puppeteer scripts, which can be launched via [test.sh](../test.sh) which while aren't very sophisticated are better than nothing!
Check [env.ts](../../coil-puppeteer-utils/src/lib/env.ts) for environment configuration values.

```bash
# from packages/coil-extension
$ ./test.sh
```

## TODO

Move to using jest with babel typescript plugins for perf. ts-jest is a little slow
